### 🛠 **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Development Setup
make setup                    # Full environment setup
make dev                      # Start development server

# Testing & Quality
make test                     # Run tests
make test-cov                 # Run tests with coverage
make lint                     # Run linting
make format                   # Format code
make ci                       # Run all CI checks locally

# Docker Deployment
make docker-build             # Build Docker image
make docker-run               # Run in container
docker-compose up --build     # Full stack with docker-compose

# Quick deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh           # Linux/Mac
scripts\deploy.bat            # Windows
```
